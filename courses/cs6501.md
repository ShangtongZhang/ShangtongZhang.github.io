title: Advanced Topics in Reinforcement Learning (Fall 2022)
permalink: /teaching/cs6501
---

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving sequential decision making problems.
In this course,
we will dive into some important concepts of RL,
such as Markov Decision Processes, function approximation, and off-policy learning,
focusing on theoretical results.  
You are expected to be comfortable with Python and reading / writing proofs involving linear algebra and probability. 
You are **NOT** expected to know RL. 
I will make sure you can catch up even if you do not know RL before.

## Grading (tentative, subject to change):
- Paper presentation (20%):  
Each student is expected to present a paper focusing on the theoretical results of the paper
- Project (80%):  
Each student is expected to complete a research project solo or in a group of size 2. The project can be theoretical but does **NOT** have to.
For example, it can also be empirical investigation or application of some theoretical results in the lecture.
The project does **NOT** have to have positive results. 
Negative results are equally welcomed as long as it answers an interesting question in a scientific way.
  - Project proposal (10%)
  - Midterm report (10%)
  - Final writeup (50%)
  - Project presentation (10%)
