Machine Learning (ML) is, with no doubt, one of the most important aspects of artificial intelligence and has enjoyed great success in various domains. 
In this course,
we will cover the theoretical foundations of ML, as well as several representative algorithms. 

## Logistics:

- Instructor: [Shangtong Zhang](/)
- Location: Mechanical Engineering Building 339    
- Time: Tuesday & Thursday, 9:30 - 10:45  
- Office Hours: 
  - Shangtong: TBA (Rice Hall 422)
- UVACanvas: [25S CS6316 Machine Learning]()
- Prerequisite:
  - (Basics of) Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Python
- Undergraduates: I am in general not against undergraduates taking this course. If you are a UVA undergraduate and believe you fulfill all the prerequisites and the textbook seems interesting and readable to you, 
please move forward directly by submitting the proper forms,
assuming I will approve it.
All the information I have about this course is available on this website,
so please exercise your judgment.
Different schools and colleges have different required forms.
It is your responsibility to figure out which form to submit and where to submit it - this is another hidden prerequisite for this course.
Due to the giant amount of forms I receive, I am not able to check the status of individual forms.
If you believe one form should have been signed, just send it again.
