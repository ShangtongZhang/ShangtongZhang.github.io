Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving sequential decision making problems
and has enjoyed tremendous success, e.g., [playing the game of Go](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961) and [training ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login).
This course is designed to cover important ideas and milestone papers of RL.

- Prerequisite:
  This course requires a good understanding of probability, linear algebra, and calculus.
- **If you need approval for enrollment,
please move forward directly by submitting the proper forms,
assuming I will approve it**.
All the information I have about this course is available on this website,
so please exercise your judgment.
Different schools and colleges have different required forms.
It is your responsibility to figure out which form to submit and where to submit it - this is another hidden prerequisite for this course.
**I will not be able to manually handle any individual enrollment / waitlist permission request until near the end of the enrollment deadline**.

## Teaching
- Textbook: We will be using some context in the following books 
  - [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)
  - [Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning)
  - [Reinforcement Learning: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05265)
  - [Reinforcement Learning: Foundations](https://sites.google.com/view/rlfoundations/home)
- Lectures: **All lectures are whiteboards. To encourage attendance, there will be no slides or notes. But I am sure you can find everything in the books above.**
As a courtesy,
I will try my best to record each lecture (though not guaranteed) and post the recordings in Canvas.
That being said, it might be good to factor this whiteboard format into consideration when enrolling in this course.

## Grading

## Policies

- Late Policy:
Each assignment has an 8-hour graceful period without any penalty. 
If you need extensions for career development purposes (e.g., attending a conference, preparing an important interview), you need to email me one week before the homework deadline. 
Everyone has a single chance for an 1-week late submission without any penalty (note that this cannot be used for HW 7.2). If you want to use this late submission opportunity, please declare [here](https://forms.gle/MQVaWW5UdoQs1uJ68). **No other hindsight extension is possible unless doctor notes or SDAC notifications are provided.** 
- Regrading Policy: For every task, one regrading request is allowed.
