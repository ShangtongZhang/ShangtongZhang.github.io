Machine Learning (ML) is, with no doubt, one of the most important aspects of artificial intelligence and has enjoyed great success in various domains. 
In this course,
we will cover theoretical foundations of ML, as well as several representative algorithms. 

**WARNING**: This course is very mathy.

## Logistics:

- Instructor: [Shangtong Zhang](/)
- Location: Mechanical Engineering Building 341    
- Time: Tuesday & Thursday, 14:00 - 15:15  
- TA: [TBA]() 
- Office Hour: 
  - Shangtong: Tuesday & Thursday 15:15 - 16:15 (Rice Hall 422)
- UVACanvas: [24S CS6316 Machine Learning](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/104488)
- Prerequisite:
  - Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Python
- Teaching: We will use the textbook [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) (UML).
We will also use [Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, and  Optimization Theory for Computer Science and Machine Learning](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/gbooks/geomath.html) (ATDO) for reference.
Both are freely available.
There will be no slides and the lectures are mostly **whiteboards**.
To encourage attendance,
I will **NOT** provide detailed notes.
<!-- I will, however, provide a [roadmap.pdf](/assets/pdf/cs_4501_fall_23/roadmap.pdf) which is used to remind myself of what to discuss next. -->
As a courtesy,
I will try my best to record each lecture (not guaranteed) and post the recording in Canvas.

## Roadmap:
All the written assignments are expected to be **PDF files** generated by LaTeX. 
[Here](/blog/latex) are some tips for LaTeX.
The final letter grade is based on curved scores.

## Policies:

- Late Policy:
If you submit within 8 hours (a grace period) after the due date,
there is no penalty.
If you submit within 24 hours after the due date, you lose 33% scores.
If you submit within 48 hours after the due date, you lose 66% scores.
If you are not able to submit within 48 hours after the due date, 
you lose all scores.
No exception will be made unless a doctor's note is provided.
- Regrading Policy: For every assignment, one regrading request is allowed. I will regrade the **entire** assignment and there is no guarantee that the score will not decrease.
