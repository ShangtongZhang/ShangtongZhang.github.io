The recent success in deep learning is largely driven by the application of large neural networks.
In this course,
we will cover the foundations of the techniques that are commonly used to train those large neural networks,
namely,
the foundations of the first-order optimization methods.
Those include gradient descent and its variants.
This course will cover both theoretical analysis and empirical implementation.

WARNING: This course is mathematically heavy but does involve programming.

## Logistics:

- Instructor: [Shangtong Zhang](/)
- Location: TBD   
- Time: Tuesday & Thursday, 14:00 - 15:15  
- TA: TBD 
- Office Hour: 
  - Shangtong: Tuesday & Thursday 15:30 - 16:30 (Rice Hall 422)
- UVACollab: [OPT-CS4501-F23]()
- Prerequisite: TBD
- Teaching: I will mostly use white boards instead of slides. The course will be recorded and the recording will be shared in Collab. I will NOT provide detailed notes.

## Topics:
We will follow the textbook [First-Order Methods in Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611974997) by Amir Beck and cover important results in the first 10 chapters.

- Linear algebra 
- Subgradients
- Conjugate functions
- Smoothness and strong convexity
- The proximal operator
- Spectral functions
- Primal and dual projected subgradient methods 
- Mirror descent
- The proximal gradient method

## Grading:
- Written Assignments
- Coding Assignments

All the written assignments are expected to be **PDF files** generated by LaTeX.
