### Recruiting

<!-- I am looking for self-motivated students interested in RL at different levels. -->

<!-- You do not need to have RL background but please take my graduate-level RL course. Feel free to drop me a line. -->
* **PhD applicants for Fall 2024 (fully funded)**  
RL / optimization background is preferred but not necessary. You are welcome to email me but please be **specific** about why you think we are in good match. 
* **master students**  
UVA CS has both thesis- and course-based masters. If you are admitted and want to do your thesis / project with me, feel free to drop me a line.
* **undergraduates**  
If you are an undergraduate in UVA and want to join my research group, feel free to drop me a line. You do not need to have RL background.
<!-- * **(remote) research interns**  
    You must have RL / optimization background. You are welcome to email me but please be specific about **how I can benefit from collaborating with you**.
    Having a concrete research plan in mind will greatly increase your chance. -->

Please attach your CV and transcripts in your email. Due to the large volume of emails I receive, I might not be able to reply to every inquiry. I apologize for this.
