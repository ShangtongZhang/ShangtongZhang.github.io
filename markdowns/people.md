I am looking for self-motivated students interested in RL at different levels.

* **PhD students that are admitted to UVA and want to find places for rotation (fully funded)**
You do not need to have RL background but please take my graduate-level RL course. Feel free to drop me a line.
* **PhD applicants for fall 2023 (fully funded)**  
RL / optimization background is preferred but not necessary. You are welcome to email me but please be **specific** about why you think we are in good match. 
* **master students**  
UVA CS has both thesis- and course-based masters. If you are admitted and want to do your thesis / project with me, feel free to drop me a line.
* **undergraduates**  
If you are an undergraduate in UVA and want to join my research group, feel free to drop me a line. You do not need to have RL background.
* **(remote) intern / collaboration**  
    From fall 2022, **not** available for summer 2022. You must have RL / optimization background. You are welcome to email me but please be specific about **how I can benefit from collaborating with you**.
    Having a concrete research plan in mind will greatly increase your chance.

You are always welcome to email me. Please attach your CV and transcripts.  
Due to the large volume of emails I receive, I might not be able to reply to every inquiry. I apologize for this. [*I will put the same effort in replying to you as the effort you put in customizing your email for me.*](/blog/inquiry)
