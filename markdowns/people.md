### Recruiting

<!-- I am looking for self-motivated students interested in RL at different levels. -->

<!-- * **PhD students that are admitted to UVA and want to find places for rotation (fully funded)** -->
<!-- You do not need to have RL background but please take my graduate-level RL course. Feel free to drop me a line. -->
* **PhD applicants for Fall 2024 (fully funded)**  
RL / optimization background is preferred but not necessary. You are welcome to email me but please be **specific** about why you think we are in good match. 
* **master students**  
UVA CS has both thesis- and course-based masters. If you are admitted and want to do your thesis / project with me, feel free to drop me a line.
* **undergraduates**  
Due to limited bandwidth, I can only work with undergraduates who have taken an RL course (at either UVA or Coursera).
If you want to email me, please describe the most interesting part (in your opinion) of the RL course you took.
An exception is the distinguished major program, please feel free to email me with your proposal for DMP.
* **(remote) research interns**
Due to limited bandwidth, I can only work with interns who already have papers that are highly related to my research.
If you want to email me, please describe how your papers align with my papers.
