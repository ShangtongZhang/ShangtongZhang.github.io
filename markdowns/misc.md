This repo is a Python implementation of the RL textbook from Sutton & Barto. 
This is my course project when I took Rich's RL course in my first term at the University of Alberta,
when the book was about to complete.

- [PyTorch Deep RL](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL)

This repo includes almost all codes of my papers during my DPhil.
It helps me prototype new ideas easily but is unfortunately on longer maintained.
