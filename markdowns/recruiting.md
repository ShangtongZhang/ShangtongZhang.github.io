* **PhD students for Fall 2025 (fully funded)**  
RL background is not necessary. You are welcome to email me but please be **specific** about why you think we are in good match.
This includes not only how you can benefit from me but also how I can benefit from working with you.
* **UVA Master students and undergraduates**  
If you are a UVA master student or undergraduate and want to do your master thesis / master project / capstone project / DMP thesis / xyz with me, please feel free to email me. I will then forward your dossier to my PhD students. They will decide whether they want to work with you, probably through additional interviews. You will primarily work with my PhD students and have ad-hoc meetings with me.
* **Research interns**   
Due to limited bandwidth, I can only work with interns who have demonstrated records that are highly related to my research.
If you want to email me, please describe how I would benefit from this collaboration.

> In any case, please add [e5274d52b4c6] in the subject of your email to indicate you have read the information above.
