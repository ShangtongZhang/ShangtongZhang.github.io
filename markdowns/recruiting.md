* **PhD students for Fall 2025 (fully funded)**  
RL background is not necessary but you need to have a good understanding of math. You are welcome to email me with your CV and transcript. Please describe why we are in a good match if this is not self-evident from your CV (if it is self-evident, you do not need to include any additional text). I read every CV I receive. If I feel we are in a potential match, I will reply with the template reply below and we can move on to the next stage. If you do not hear back from me within 3 - 4 business days, it is not because I missed your email (my mailbox, including junk folder, has zero unread email). Instead, it is because I feel we might not be in a good match -- I appologize that I am not able to reply to your email in this case due to the large volume of emails I receive. I believe this protocol can save time for both of us. Below is the template reply when I feel we are in a potential match:
> Dear XXX,
> 
> It is very nice to hear from you. I think you have a competitive background but it's too early now to say anything about Fall 2X. If you are interested in working with me, please apply officially when the portal opens and mention me as your potential advisor (please input my name as Shangtong Zhang, not Zhang, Shangtong, or any other possible combinations with titles). I remember the application fee and GRE should be waived automatically, at least it is the case last year. I usually meet with short-listed applicants after the application deadline. Wish you all the best for your career!

> Best,  
> Shangtong

* **UVA Master students and undergraduates**  
If you are a UVA master student or undergraduate and want to do your master thesis / master project / capstone project / DMP thesis / independent study / ... with me, please feel free to email me. I will then forward your dossier to my PhD students. They will decide whether they want to work with you, probably through additional interviews. You will primarily work with my PhD students and have ad-hoc meetings with me.
* **Research interns**   
Due to limited bandwidth, I can only work with interns who have demonstrated records that are highly related to my research.
If you want to email me, please describe how I would benefit from this collaboration.

> In any case, please add [e5274d52b4c6] in the subject of your email to indicate you have read the information above.
