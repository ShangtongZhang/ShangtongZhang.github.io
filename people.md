I am looking for self-motivated students interested in RL at different levels:
* PhD students that are admitted to UVA and want to find places for rotation (fully funded)
* PhD applicants for fall 2023 (fully funded)
* master students (UVA CS has both thesis- and course-based masters)
* undergraduate research assistants
* (remote) interns (from fall 2022, **not** available for summer 2022)

If you are interested in working on RL with me, feel free to email me with your CV and **concrete** research interest.
