I am looking for self-motivated students interested in RL at different levels.

* **PhD students that are admitted to UVA and want to find places for rotation (fully funded)**
You do not need to have RL background but please take my graduate-level RL course. Feel free to drop me a line.
* **PhD applicants for fall 2023 (fully funded)**  
RL / optimization background is preferred but not necessary. You are welcome to email me but please be **specific** about why you think we are in good match. 
* **master students**  
UVA CS has both thesis- and course-based masters. If you are admitted and want to do your thesis / project with me, feel free to drop me a line.
* **undergraduates**  
If you are an undergraduate in UVA and want to join my research group, feel free to drop me a line. You do not need to have RL background.
* **(remote) intern / collaboration**  
    From fall 2022, **not** available for summer 2022. You must have RL / optimization background. You are welcome to email me but please be specific about **how I can benefit from collaborating with you**.
    Having a concrete research plan in mind will greatly increase your chance.

You are always welcome to email me. Please attach your CV and transcripts.  
Due to the large volume of emails I receive, I might not be able to reply to every inquiry. I apologize for this. *I will put the same effort in replying to you as the effort you put in customizing your email for me.* 


#### Tips for inquiry ("套磁")  
I wrote lots of emails for inquiry when I was a PhD applicant and received lots of emails for inquiry when I started to form my research group. Here I want to share some general tips to make the inquiry more effective. I unfortunately made some mistakes during my application. I hope you can avoid them and wish you all the best for your application.
* **Please customize your email**. Do not put experiences that are irrelevant to the professor's research. First, the professor is likely not interested in those experiences. Second, the professor might not know those fields well so he/she cannot really infer much from those experiences. Third, those experiences may make the email unnecessarily longer, making the information that is truly valuable less visible. Exercise your judgement to determine what information is relevant. For example, I am in general not interested in experiences in CV and NLP, unless you can connect them with RL.
* **Please think from the professor's perspective**. It is important for students that they can benefit from the supervision. But it is equally important that professors can also benefit from the supervision. You might want to show your intent to make this supervision mutually beneficial. For example, you can read the professor's papers and ask some interesting questions or propose some extensions. I understand paper reading might be time consuming but there are lots of other options as well.

As an extreme example, I once received an email that spelled both my name and my university wrong. But the content is highly customized and is very persuading that I believe I can benefit from this collaboration. So I set up a meeting with the student very quickly.
