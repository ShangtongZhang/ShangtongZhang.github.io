\section{Remarks}
The \LaTeX{} file for generating this PDF is provided in the same folder. 
Please use it for this homework.

Focus on the rigor of math and explain each equation you write if it is not as clear as $1+1 = 2$.
Since this is the first homework,
we will be relatively generous in grading.
